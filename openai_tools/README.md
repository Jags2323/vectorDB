# OpenAI Tools

This repository provides a convenient way to call functions for the OpenAI API.

Note: You must have an OpenAI API key stored in the environment variable "OPENAI_API_KEY".

- `tools.json`: Description of the functions with parameter definitions.
- `functions.py`: Code for the functions that the model has access to.
